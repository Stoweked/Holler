# Authentication Feature

> Archived reference only. The paths and dependencies below describe the earlier Supabase authentication implementation, not the current application architecture. This source is excluded from the React UI handoff.

## 📌 Overview

The **Authentication** feature handles all aspects of user identity, including sign-up, login, session management, and password recovery. It integrates directly with Supabase Auth and provides the UI flows for onboarding new users.

## 📂 Internal Structure

All code for this feature is self-contained in `src/features/auth`.
